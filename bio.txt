V1:

Seattle had better prepare for the next big thing! My name is Tyler Newton and currently I am training to become a software/app developer. Skills are being gained everyday and my Professional Brand is being constructed as we speak! My years spent in Customer Service and my delight in helping those in need were what made me realize that I could make the world a better place through code. Currently only a little background experience in a highschool setting with Programming, but definitely not lacking in Human Relations! In my spare time I like to play games, fall of walls and improve myself by learning various new skills.
